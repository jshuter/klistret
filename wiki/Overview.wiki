The page is an overview of the major components inside Klistret.

== Overview ==
Klistret provides in the initial release only core services but subsequent versions will expand to include extensions for: change management, automatic installation, and test management.

The basic idea is to reverse the existing paradigm with CMDB repositories from a discovery warehouse to a configuration generator.  Medium and large organizations often have a landscape composed of several test levels before entering production.  Klistret intends to minimize the negative impact of human error in conjunction with installations or configuration of developed IT applications by generating the runtime environment automatically.

At the heart of Klistret is a hierarchy of configuration items constructed in a series of extending XML schema.  This tree structure of CIs represents configuration elements, their relations and their transportation proxies.  The XML schema is rolled into POJOs suitable for marshaling from the database model through the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer REST] services externally into a wide variety of media formats (types).
