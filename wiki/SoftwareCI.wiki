Software is a central player for inventory both for what an organization consumes from other organizations och what produces itself.

== Description ==
Components are inventory.  Software being a component derivative is also inventory.  To limit confusion it is important that the initial definition 
of software keeps itself inside the conceptual boundaries of inventory.  The [http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim DMTF CIM] has no obvious schema for software despite it being the first thing organizations either produce or allocate.  The [http://www.wbemsolutions.com/tutorials/CIM/cim-model-app.html DMTF Application] encapsulates the general concepts of software by looking at it from the angle of systems that need features and functionality.  All of sudden the basic need for modeling inventory explodes into a bear hug around services and systems.  [http://ant.apache.org/ivy Ivy] (similarly Maven underneath the monolith of project theory) has a simpler approach.  There is nothing within the Ivy documentation which compares Ivy as a dependency manager and modelling software as a CI.  However, Ivy like Maven unknowingly is a modern representation of software as inventory.

Ivy talks about modules rather than using the word _software_.  Software is more inline with CMDB terminology.  Modules and software are logically equivalent.  Regardless if software is open source or commercial there is an organization which produces the software.  The identification of software as a module normally consists of an organization, a module name, a version and potentially an organizational type.
