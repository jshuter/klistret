Each element amassed in the Element table has a _configuration_ column which derives from the Element CI.

== Description ==
The CI inherits from the [BaseCI Base CI] and doesn't add a whole lot other than ownership.

=== Characteristics ===
Every property below has the _http://www.klistret.com/cmdb/ci/commons_ namespace.  The Element CI is abstract.

|| *Property* || *Description* || *Required* || *Unbounded* || *Key* || *Context* ||
|| Ownership || A complex type composed of either a _Name_ simple type or a complex _Contact_ with room for _Name_, _Telephone_, _EMail_, _Organization_, and _Function_.  The _Contact_ structure is immature and a candidate for revamping.  Regardless, Ownership tells others who is responsible for the instance. || No || No || No || Maybe ||

== Usage ==
An Element CI is never instantiated but like the Relation CI splits the Base CI into 2 distinct camps.
