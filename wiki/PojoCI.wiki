Whenever a CI either element or relation is passed it is wrapped inside a corresponding Pojo that maps directly to a database table.

== Description ==

=== Characteristics ===
Every property below has the _http://www.klistret.com/cmdb/ci/pojo_ namespace.

These properties are common for all POJO wrappers (Element, Relation, Element Type and Relation Type):
|| *Property* || *Description* || *Required* || *Unbounded* || *Key* || *Context* ||
|| id || Unique identifier (generated by the database and not set when creating new data). || Maybe || No || Yes || No ||
|| fromTimeStamp || When the record is considered active (currently no component checks this time stamp to see if the record is really active in the near future).  This is a XML [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime dateTime].  || No || No || No || No ||
|| toTimeStamp || When the record is considered inactive (be careful setting this in the future since not all components react to any other than a null value).  A null value means that the record is active.  This is a XML [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime dateTime]. || No || No || No || No ||
|| createId || A string ID restricted to a maximum of 10 characters. || No || No || No || No ||
|| createTimeStamp || When the record was created.  This is a XML [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime dateTime]. || No || No || No || No ||
|| updateTimeStamp || When the record was last updated.  This is a XML [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime dateTime]. || No || No || No || No ||

The Element Pojo adds on:
|| *Property* || *Description* || *Required* || *Unbounded* || *Key* || *Context* ||
|| name || The name of the record || Yes || No || Maybe || Maybe ||
|| type || Reference to the Element Type table (i.e. points out the namespace of the CI document in the _configuration_ column.) || Yes || No || Yes || No ||
|| configuration || An XML column that carries the actual CI document with the same schema type as the one referenced by the _type_ property. || Yes || No || No || No ||
|| sourceRelations || List of Relation entities that are owned by the record. || No || Yes || No || No ||
|| destinationRelations || List of Relation entities that are target the record of others. || No || Yes || No || No ||

The Relation Pojo adds on:
|| *Property* || *Description* || *Required* || *Unbounded* || *Key* || *Context* ||
|| type || Reference to the Relation Type table (i.e. points out the namespace of the CI document in the _configuration_ column.) || Yes || No || Yes || No ||
|| configuration || An XML column that carries the actual CI document with the same schema type as the one referenced by the _type_ property. || Yes || No || No || No ||
