Whenever a CI either element or relation is passed it is wrapped inside a corresponding Pojo that maps directly to a database table.

## Description ##

### Characteristics ###
Every property below has the _http://www.klistret.com/cmdb/ci/pojo_ namespace.

These properties are common for all POJO wrappers (Element, Relation, Element Type and Relation Type):
| **Property** | **Description** | **Required** | **Unbounded** | **Key** | **Context** |
|:-------------|:----------------|:-------------|:--------------|:--------|:------------|
| id | Unique identifier (generated by the database and not set when creating new data). | Maybe | No | Yes | No |
| fromTimeStamp | When the record is considered active (currently no component checks this time stamp to see if the record is really active in the near future).  This is a XML [dateTime](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime).  | No | No | No | No |
| toTimeStamp | When the record is considered inactive (be careful setting this in the future since not all components react to any other than a null value).  A null value means that the record is active.  This is a XML [dateTime](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime). | No | No | No | No |
| createId | A string ID restricted to a maximum of 10 characters. | No | No | No | No |
| createTimeStamp | When the record was created.  This is a XML [dateTime](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime). | No | No | No | No |
| updateTimeStamp | When the record was last updated.  This is a XML [dateTime](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime). | No | No | No | No |

The Element Pojo adds on:
| **Property** | **Description** | **Required** | **Unbounded** | **Key** | **Context** |
|:-------------|:----------------|:-------------|:--------------|:--------|:------------|
| name | The name of the record | Yes | No | Maybe | Maybe |
| type | Reference to the Element Type table (i.e. points out the namespace of the CI document in the _configuration_ column.) | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| configuration | An XML column that carries the actual CI document with the same schema type as the one referenced by the _type_ property. | Yes | No | No | No |
| sourceRelations | List of Relation entities that are owned by the record. | No | Yes | No | No |
| destinationRelations | List of Relation entities that are target the record of others. | No | Yes | No | No |

The Relation Pojo adds on:
| **Property** | **Description** | **Required** | **Unbounded** | **Key** | **Context** |
|:-------------|:----------------|:-------------|:--------------|:--------|:------------|
| type | Reference to the Relation Type table (i.e. points out the namespace of the CI document in the _configuration_ column.) | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| configuration | An XML column that carries the actual CI document with the same schema type as the one referenced by the _type_ property. | Yes | No | No | No |
| source | Element that owns the relationship | Yes | No | No | No |
| destination| Element that is the target of the relationship | Yes | No | No | No |
| configuration | Relations also have a specific CI that must correspond to the _type_ property.  Although the flora av relationship CIs restrictive and much smaller than with elements. | Yes | No | No | No |

The Relation Type och Element Type Pojos have the common properties plus only a _name_ property like that for the Element Pojo.

## Usage ##
The Pojo classes only only wrappers for the underlying CIs.  Their purpose is to provide a little bookkeeping, unique identification and map to a physical table.  Despite the Pojos carrying limited information they are mandatory for XPath filters.  Every filter must be absolute starting from either an Element, Relation, Element Type or Relation Type axis.
