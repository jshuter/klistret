Klistret (swedish for glue) is an open source CMDB solution oriented towards designing an IT landscape rather than discovery of existing resources.  Many CMDB products are specialized to run within a federation that presents runtime views.  Klistret focuses on the construction phase and the changes activities necessary to reach a viable runtime.

Currently, the project is in the initial stages of publishing core functionality and performance testing.  During the course of this year the core, blueprints and fresher GUI will be available through a public repository.  The project's Wiki describes each of these components in detail.  Even with the beta state one can get a feel of Klistret by looking at how [querying](QueryingCI.md) is done, how to [setup](WeblogicConfiguration.md), what [CIs](CI.md) are supported and how to build [clients](PerlClient.md).
