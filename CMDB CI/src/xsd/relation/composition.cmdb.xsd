			<xs:documentation>
				Composition is a stronger variant of the "owns a" or
				association relationship; composition is more specific
				than aggregation. It is represented with a solid diamond
				shape.

				Composition usually has a strong life cycle dependency
				between instances of the container class and instances
				of the contained class(es): If the container is
				destroyed, normally every instance that it contains is
				destroyed as well. Note that a part can (where allowed)
				be removed from a composite before the composite is
				deleted, and thus not be deleted as part of the
				composite.

				Composition is more geared towards physical
				relationships (construction).
