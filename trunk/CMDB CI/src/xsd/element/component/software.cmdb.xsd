				The artifact file name extension is more closely
				associated with its
				format. For example, in the case of Java archives
				the artifact type
				"jar" indicates that it is indeed a Java archive as
				per the JAR File
				specification. The file name extension happens to be
				"jar" as well.

			<xs:documentation>
				Software publications are artifacts that have a
				relation keyed off usage to a Software CI where the Software CI is
				the owner or source. Compressed package formats are often preferred
				because they are easier to manage, transfer and store. For the same
				reasons, only one or a few artifacts per module are commonly used.
				However, artifacts can be of any file type and any number of them
				can be declared in a single module.
