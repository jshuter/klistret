				A component is physical. Good examples of components are
				software or hardware that are inventory. When a company
				buys in a PC offline it is just a component with a
				serial number, capacity in terms of CPU and memory plus
				other stuff like network cards. It has latent functions
				but these capabilities aren't important until the
				component is put in a live situation and suddenly a
				component becomes a system (or a logical entity).
