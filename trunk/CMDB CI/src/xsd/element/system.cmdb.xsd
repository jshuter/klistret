				A system is a logical framework constituting a runtime
				made up of software or hardware components
				(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System). In laymans term a
				system is where stuff (services) executes whereas
				components (the physical stuff) are inventory. For
				example, a online server provides functions for running
				software and is a computer system. The actual type of
				server offline might be a Unix machine. The machine
				disjointed from it's runtime state is just a machine or
				component bought in buy an IT department.
