				Aggregation is a variant of the "has a" or association
				relationship; aggregation is more specific than
				association. It is an association that represents a
				part-whole or part-of relationship. As a type of
				association, an aggregation can be named and have the
				same adornments that an association can. However, an
				aggregation may not involve more than two classes.

				Aggregation can occur when a class is a collection or
				container of other classes, but where the contained
				classes do not have a strong life cycle dependency on
				the containerâ€”essentially, if the container is
				destroyed, its contents are not.

				Aggregation is suitable for logical relationships
				(construction).
